## What is Max Prod?

Elon Musk breaks his working days into five-minute chunks. Each chunk has a specific objective. This technique is called the “time blocking” method and you will see many people on Youtube trying to follow it. However, it feels like it is almost impossible to follow. Keeping which task is done, how much time passed, and etc. Already I have a headache by thinking.

Check the [DEMO](https://ryanwlee.com/maxprod)

MaxProd is a tool helping you to make maximum productivity by listing the tasks you need to do and keep track of what has done and how much time left. Simply add your tasks, set how much time you will spend on each task (default is 15 mins), hit play, and be productive like Elon Musk!

## What did I use to build this?

MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React js, Node js). Node js / Express server is deployed on Heroku and MongoDB on Atlas. If you want to run locally, clone this and the [client](https://github.com/dmrg2/maxprod). Of course, modify .envExample to .env.

## What is next?

Let me know if there is any issue! Love to fix. Also, React Native will be available soon.
